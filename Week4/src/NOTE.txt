This very simple program utilizes the ActionListener and the KeyListener interface. 
I will only be using one of three methods from the KeyListener implementation. 
The keyPressed() method.

This program is looking for a keyboard input, which is registered to the KeyListener as a "keycode."

Can you figure out which one's the "Fire" button?  :D
